    <p>There's much written on www about history of the <br>Internet.For example, about the first graphical Internet <br>browser on the web - Mosaic. </p><br>
<blockquote>Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical <br>World Wide Web browser, released on April 22,<br> 1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.<br> A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later. </blockquote> 
Today's Internet browsers we use today<br> (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),<br> got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.<br>
